# 🏭 The Factory

**One founder. One AI agent. Seven products. Zero sleep required.**

This is the story of how a solo founder uses an autonomous AI agent to build, market, and operate multiple products simultaneously, shipping more in one night than most teams do in a week.

---

## What Is This?

The Factory is a real experiment in AI-augmented solo entrepreneurship. No hype, no theory. Just honest documentation of what works, what doesn't, and what it actually looks like when you give an AI agent real tools and real autonomy.

**The setup:**
- 🧑 One human (product person, not a developer by trade)
- 🏰 One AI agent ([Rook](docs/meet-rook.md), built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw))
- 📱 Seven active products across health, travel, education, and developer tools
- 💬 Communication via Telegram (a private group called "The Factory")
- ⏰ 24/7 autonomous operation with human oversight

**The result:** On any given night, Rook can spawn 19 sub-agents, produce 40+ files across 7 projects, and have a morning report ready before coffee.

## The Products

| Product | What It Does | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 🧬 **Darwin** | AI that evolves landing pages through natural selection | Live, collecting data |
| 🍽️ **Chowdown** | Free AI-powered macro tracking (snap a photo, get macros) | Live in production |
| 🧭 **Pocket Guide** | Photo → AI identifies landmark → personalised voice guide | Built, polishing |
| 🌱 **Root Juice** | Smart plant care with environment-aware watering schedules | Built, polishing |
| 📖 **Story Time** | Kids co-create stories → AI generates → voice reads aloud | Research phase |
| 📚 **Book Social** | Position-aware comments in books (social Kindle) | Research phase |
| 🚗 **Stitch** | Crowdsourced traffic enforcement via voice reporting | Research phase |

## What You'll Find Here

How to use an AI agent as an unfair advantage. The full breakdown: setup, economics, specific tactics, and real numbers.

### 🌙 [The Overnight Factory](docs/overnight-factory.md)
What happens when you tell your AI agent "work until 7:30am, prepare everything, publish nothing" and go to sleep.

### 💡 [Moonshot Ideas](docs/moonshot-ideas.md)
Cross-pollination concepts, platform plays, and unconventional monetisation angles across the portfolio.

### 📊 [Project Dashboard](docs/project-dashboard.md)
Live status of all seven products: priorities, metrics, and what's next.

### 🧬 [Darwin: The Evolution Engine](docs/darwin.md)
Deep dive into building an A/B testing tool that treats landing page optimisation as natural selection.

### 🍽️ [Chowdown: Free Forever](docs/chowdown.md)
How a free macro tracker competes with apps charging £50+/year, and the B2B angle nobody expects.

## The Economics

Running an AI agent factory isn't free, but it's dramatically cheaper than the alternative:

| Resource | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| AI agent infrastructure | ~£50-80 |
| AI model usage (Claude) | ~£150-400 |
| Tool subscriptions | ~£80-150 |
| **Total** | **~£280-630** |

Compare: a part-time VA costs £600-1,200/month. A marketing freelancer, £800-2,400. The agent works 24/7, never forgets context, and gets better at your specific business every day.

## Why Open Source This?

Because the most interesting things happen in public. And because most founders have no idea this is even possible yet.

This isn't a product. It's a documentation of a workflow that anyone can replicate with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and a bit of curiosity.
