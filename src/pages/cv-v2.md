## Profile

Builder who ships. 8+ years going from idea to deployed product across SaaS, marketplaces, and B2B platforms. Writes TypeScript and SQL daily, builds with AI-assisted tooling (Cursor, Claude, Copilot), and deploys to production — not decks. Currently building and shipping features for a platform serving 5,000+ venues and enterprise clients.
