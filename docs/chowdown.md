# 🍽️ Chowdown: Free Forever

**The macro tracker that's actually free. No, really.**

## The Problem

Every macro tracking app follows the same playbook: free tier with crippling limitations, then £40-80/year to unlock what should be basic features. MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, MacroFactor, Lose It — they all do it.

Macro tracking isn't rocket science. It's a database lookup with a nice UI. There's no reason it should cost £50/year.

## The Solution

Chowdown is a macro tracker that's genuinely, permanently free. Not "free with a paywall after 3 foods." Not "free but we sell your data." Actually free.

**How it works:**
1. Snap a photo of your food
2. AI identifies it and returns macros instantly
3. Track your day, hit your targets
4. No sign-up wall, no premium tier, no ads

**The tech:** React/Vite frontend, Firebase backend, Gemini AI for food recognition. PWA that works on any device.

## The "Free Forever" Positioning

This is the killer differentiator. In a market where every competitor charges, being genuinely free is a statement.

It's also a viable strategy:
- **No server costs per user** (Firebase free tier is generous, AI costs are pennies per scan)
- **Revenue via donations** (Buy Me a Coffee) and potential B2B licensing
- **Growth through word-of-mouth** (people share things that save them money)

## The B2B Angle Nobody Expects

The B2B corporate wellness market is worth £53 billion globally. Companies like Apple, Google, and Netflix offer health perks to employees.

Chowdown could be positioned as a "nutrition benefit": 
- £1-3 per employee per month
- Company dashboard with anonymised team nutrition trends
- Integration with existing corporate wellness platforms
- Zero friction for employees (it's already free and easy)

10 companies × 100 employees × £2/mo = £24,000/year. Without touching the consumer product.

*Chowdown is the #2 priority in The Factory. The thesis: in a market full of paywalls, being genuinely free is the best marketing strategy there is.*
